gcode-syntax (dark mode)
============

G-code syntax highlighting for Notepad ++ with UDL2.0, modified from [/robEllenberg/gcode-syntax](https://github.com/robEllenberg/gcode-syntax) to have better colors for dark mode.

### To install this syntax highlighter:

1. Make sure you have [Notepad++ 6.x.x](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or above installed to use the new user defined languages
2. Clone this repository or just download the [`gcode.xml`](https://github.com/Adam-Kay/gcode-syntax/blob/master/gcode.xml)  file (that's all you need)
3. In Notepad++, in the **Language** tab, go to **User-Defined Language** â†’ **Define Your Language...**
4. Click "Import", then browse to the downloaded `gcode.xml` file. If you see "Import was successful", then the G-code syntax highlighter is installed.
